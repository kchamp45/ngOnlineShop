This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  If you have not done so already, please set up an account with Firebase.com.  You will be given specific credentials that will need to be stored in a file called "api-key.ts".  It will look like this:
export var masterFirebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "xxxx",
    authDomain: "xxxx.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://xxxx.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "fir-test-88e40",
    storageBucket: "xxxx.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "xxxx"
  };

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
